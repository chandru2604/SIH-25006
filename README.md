## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution


The proposed solution is a comprehensive Digital Farm Management and Biosecurity Portal designed to guide pig and poultry farmers in implementing standardized biosecurity measures. The platform will provide a personalized dashboard where farmers can conduct risk assessments based on farm size, location, livestock density, and current disease trends. The system will generate customized biosecurity plans, checklist-based monitoring tools, and digital record-keeping features to track farm activities such as sanitation routines, vaccination schedules, visitor logs, and feed management.

To address the core problem, the portal will simplify complex biosecurity protocols into actionable steps using videos, illustrations, and guided modules. The inclusion of automated alerts will enable farmers to identify risks early and take preventive measures promptly. Interactive learning modules will ensure farmers stay updated on best practices, while the modular architecture ensures scalability and integration with government databases.

The solution’s uniqueness lies in its farmer-first design, combining disease intelligence, compliance tracking, and e-learning in a single platform. The integration of real-time outbreak data and AI-driven recommendations will help farmers make informed decisions rapidly. The platform ensures accessibility through multilingual support, offline mode, and mobile-first UI design, making it functional even in remote, low-connectivity areas.

## Technical Approach

The development of the portal will use a robust technology stack combining web and mobile frameworks. The backend may be developed using Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js, while the frontend will use React/Angular for a responsive and interactive user interface. For the mobile version, Flutter or React Native can be used to ensure cross-platform compatibility. A secure cloud database such as Firebase or AWS RDS will store farm-level data, while real-time notifications will be enabled through APIs.

The implementation process begins with requirement gathering and creation of a detailed architecture diagram. User flows will be developed to define how farmers navigate through modules such as risk assessment, training, compliance tracking, and alerts. Once the prototype is created, iterative testing will be undertaken to ensure user-friendliness and accuracy. The final system will include dashboards for farmers, veterinarians, and government officials, ensuring transparent communication and easy data access.

## Feasibility and Viability

The solution is highly feasible due to the increasing penetration of smartphones and digital literacy among farmers. The government’s emphasis on digital agriculture further supports successful implementation. Cloud-based infrastructure ensures scalability, while modern frameworks guarantee stability and performance.

Potential challenges include limited internet connectivity in rural areas, reluctance among farmers to adopt digital tools, and accuracy of disease-related data. These risks can be addressed by offering offline functionality, conducting awareness workshops, and integrating verified government data sources. Continuous feedback loops and updates will ensure the platform remains relevant and effective.

## Impact and Benefits

The proposed solution will have a transformative impact on the livestock sector by enhancing biosecurity awareness and reducing the risk of disease outbreaks. Farmers will benefit from improved livestock health, reduced financial losses, and increased productivity. The digital framework also promotes sustainable farming practices and supports national food security goals. Socially, it empowers small and marginal farmers by giving them access to expert guidance and eliminating dependence on external middlemen. Environmentally, improved biosecurity reduces the need for excessive antibiotic use and minimizes pathogen spread.

## Research and References

The research for this project involves studying existing biosecurity frameworks, veterinary guidelines, and disease surveillance systems provided by the Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), and OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health). Additional insights are drawn from scientific literature on disease transmission, farmer training models, and digital agriculture platforms used globally. These references form the foundation for designing a scientifically accurate, user-friendly, and scalable solution.
